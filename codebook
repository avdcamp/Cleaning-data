This codebook holds information on the cleaning data assignment.

The tidy dataset is created out of a dataset containing 564 columns/variables and 10299 observations.
None of these variables contain NA's, meaning there is no missing data.

subjectID: integer representing the person of which the data were collected (censored)
activityId: integer representing the activity (categorical)
activityDesc: description of the activity (categorical)

The remaining 561 variables are all continuous, having values between -1 and 1, stored in scientific notation 
(e.g. 3.7713126e-001). The units for these variables is unknown to me.

For the analysis we summarized the data on subject ID / activity level, which leads to (30 subjects * 6 activities) 180 observations.
When summarizing, we take the average of all variables on mean and standard deviation.
